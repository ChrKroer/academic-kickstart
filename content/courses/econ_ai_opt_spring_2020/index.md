### Course Info

* *Instructor:* [ Christian Kroer ](http://www.christiankroer.com)
* *Time:* Mondays & Wednesdays 1:10-2:25pm
* *Location:* 233 Mudd
* *Office hours:* Wednesday 2:25-3:30pm (or anytime; but email me first in that case)

### Course Summary
Economics, AI, and Optimization is an interdisciplinary course that will cover selected topics at the intersection of economics, operations research, and computer science. A recurring theme in the course will be how economic solution concepts are enabled at scale via AI and optimization methods. We will describe several successful practical applications, including how to:

* Make a poker AI
* Fairly allocate course seats to students, food to food banks, etc
* Protect wildlife, airports, or the power grid
* Conduct large-scale auctions for spectrum or Internet ads


### Outline
A rough outline is as follows:

* Intro to game theory and market design
* Nash equilibrium
  * Zero-sum games, minimax theorem
  * First-order methods/Online convex optimization/regret minimization in games
  * Deep learning for solving games at scale
  *	How the above is used in making superhuman poker AIs
* Security games
  * Stackelberg equilibrium
  * Basic Stackelberg security game model
  * Mixed-integer programming, deep learning for scaling up
  * Applications to airport, wildlife, power grid security
* Market design
  * Fisher markets and market equilibrium
  * Optimization methods for computing market equilibria
  * Machine learning methods for large markets
  * fair division, course allocation, 
  * Internet ad auctions
  * Spectrum auctions

We will also cover some subset of the following:

* Matching markets
* Data science in multiagent systems

### Textbooks

The primary book is:

* [ Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) ](/files/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf)  by Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, and Vazirani (it's free)

Additionally, we may use some sections of the following books. They are also recommended for supplementary reading:

* [ Handbook of Computational Social Choice (HCSC) ](http://www.cambridge.org/download_file/898428) by Brandt, Conitzer, Endriss, Lang, & Procaccia (it's free, password: cam1CSC)
* [ Multiagent Systems (MS) ](http://www.masfoundations.org/download.html) by Leyton-Brown & Shoham (it's free)
* [Twenty Lectures on Algorithmic Game Theory (TLAGT)](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/algorithmics-complexity-computer-algebra-and-computational-g/twenty-lectures-algorithmic-game-theory?format=PB) by Tim Roughgarden (the individual notes can be found on [Tim's website](http://timroughgarden.org/notes.html) under the course "Algorithmic Game Theory")
