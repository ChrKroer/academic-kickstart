In this post I collect a list of books that I recommend for getting up to speed on the various types of math and optimization used in my research.

First off, [the lecture notes](http://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/courses/s20_8100/) for my class if you want to get some background on my research areas. These are much shorter reads than what is given below. However, it would be useful to have read at least Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis' book and (most of) Boyd and Vandenberghe's book.

## Optimization Foundations

The following are my two favorite resources for getting started on various aspects of optimization as it pertains to my research. 

* [Introduction to Linear Optimization](http://athenasc.com/linoptbook.html) by Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis.  Great starting point. Most other optimization topics rely on linear optimization results covered here. Chapters 1,2, and 4 are most important.
* [Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by Boyd and Vandenberghe. An excellent book for getting started with more general convex optimization. Chapters 2-5, 9, and 10.

The following are more advanced books that are particularly comprehensive for various topics:

* [A Modern Introduction to Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13213.pdf) by Orabona. Excellent coverage of contemporary (circa 2019) online learning.
* [Lectures on Modern Convex Optimization](http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/LMCO_LN2019NoSolutions.pdf) by Nemirovski. Comprehensive treatment of topics such as conic programming, SDPs, interior point methods, and mirror descent/mirror prox-type algorithms.



## Game Theory Foundations
The AGT book has excellent introductions to many areas of game theory, targeted at computer scientists.

* [ Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) ](http://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/files/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf)  by Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, and Vazirani (it's free). Chapters 1-6, 9-11

If one is interested in auction theory, then the following book is recommended:

* [Auction Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Auction-Theory-Vijay-Krishna/dp/0123745071) by Vijay Krishna

The following books are useful but slightly more topical in nature:

* [ Handbook of Computational Social Choice (HCSC) ](http://www.cambridge.org/download_file/898428) by Brandt, Conitzer, Endriss, Lang, & Procaccia (it's free, password: cam1CSC)
* [ Multiagent Systems (MS) ](http://www.masfoundations.org/download.html) by Leyton-Brown & Shoham (it's free)
* [Twenty Lectures on Algorithmic Game Theory (TLAGT)](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/algorithmics-complexity-computer-algebra-and-computational-g/twenty-lectures-algorithmic-game-theory?format=PB) by Tim Roughgarden (the individual notes can be found on [Tim's website](http://timroughgarden.org/notes.html) under the course "Algorithmic Game Theory")


## Probability Theory


While not of primary importance in my research, I sometimes find myself needing to use concentration inequalities under various assumptions. When that happens, I consult the below resources.

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_inequality) This gives a nice overview of quite a few of the most useful concentration inequalities
* [Concentration Inequalities](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~lugosi/mlss_conc.pdf) by Boucheron, Lugosi, and Bousquet. When Wikipedia fails you, this short text can sometimes be of help.
